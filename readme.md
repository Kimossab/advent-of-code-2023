My stupid solutions to the AoC of ~~2021~~ ~~2022~~

These are all my solutions for the AoC of ~~2021~~ ~~2022 in typescript~~ 2023 in Kotlin

## How to run

If you want to run this (I don't know why you would, there's better solutions out there).

You need to run this through maven... I'm still not sure how as I use the ide to just click buttons, and it does things.
I'll get back to you in a while if I remember to update this further...

The only other thing to note is that if you want to download the input of your puzzles automatically you need to replace
the string `REPLACE_ME` that you can find in the properties file inside the resources of the main of the src... yea...
thanks java... [HERE](./src/main/resources/application.properties)

The session id value you can find if you open dev tools in the advent of code website, go to the cookies section and
find the value for the `session` cookie. Copy it and paste it in the file mentioned above.

### Inputs

The inputs folder is where all the inputs live, if you set up the properties file like explained above you don't need to
worry, they'll be downloaded to this folder. If you don't want to do that, you can download the inputs from the puzzle
and save it as a `txt` file with the number of the day as the file name, inside a folder with the name of the year of
AoC. (Example: `./inputs/2023/1.txt`)
